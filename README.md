StarWarsShooter(unofficial) was created as a fun, Atari style game heavily influenced by Space Invaders 

This game was created by Vikku Ponnaganti, Brian Boyle, and Kevin Sampson for our Object Oriented Design course at Merrimack College.

The game is essentially a SpaceInvaders clone but with a Star Wars inspired twist added to it. Our very own Kevin Sampson designed all game image assets in 
Adobe Photoshop, a complement to his minor in Graphic Design. It is written in Java and is playable as a GUI.
